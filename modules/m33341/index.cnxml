  <md:title>SCORM 2.0: Appendix 1</md:title>
  <md:abstract>This module is an appendix that highlights Use Case or Stakeholder issues not covered within the body of the original document.  It was written as a section of an original document titled, SCORM 2.0: Learning in the Mainstream and was submitted to LETSI for consideration in their SCORM 2.0 project and the SCORM 2.0 Workshop in Pensacola, Florida in October 2008.</md:abstract>

            <title>SCORM 2.0: Appendix 1</title>
            <para id="mid-002">The focus of the paper SCORM 2.0:  Learning in the Mainstream is to argue that a diverse range of communities require a different type of SCORM to that we have known so far.  It would be impractical to try to provide a use case for the each of the possible examples.  Instead a few links to projects or activities that provide examples of the requirements have been provided with some brief associated comments.  These should also be considered together with the perspectives already provided in earlier sections.</para>

                <item>Examples on the LETSI SCORM 2.0 FAQ page (available <link id="mid-004" window="new" url="http://www.letsi.org/letsi/display/nextscorm/SCORM+2.0+FAQ">here</link>)
                    <para id="mid-005">Each of the examples on this page has a potential to go beyond their current use of SCORM as a mechanism to upload the same course to different LMSs.  In particular, the last two examples are important to consider.  In the case of Chrysler/BBDO there was already a trend to reuse content originally developed by one department (eg marketing materials, technical specifications etc) as part of an aggregated course delivered to different audiences.  Clever use of SCORM in its current format enabled a significant flexibility in the reuse of content.  It was indicated at their presentation at Masie’s Learning 2007 event that they were considering the added flexibility possible through structured content models and were interested to pursue the value of this approach.</para></item>
                <item>SociaLearn:  Bridging the Gap between Web 2.0 and Higher Education (available <link id="mid-006" window="new" url="http://mfeldstein.com/sociallearn-bridging-the-gap-between-web-20-and-higher-education/">here</link>)
                    <para id="mid-007">Martin Weller’s guest post on Michael Feldstein’s eLiterate blog provides an interesting perspective on the challenges faced by Higher Education.  In particular, a few themes and/or comments are relevant.  First, that the decentralisation of the monolithic LMS in favour of a suite of Web 2.0 tools is where the current trend is heading.  In that context and with a goal driven approach to learning, the idea is to pull content, support and infrastructure together to allow the learner to orchestrate their progress.  This is consistent with the scoping issues raised previously and their implications for content.</para></item>
                <item>Siemens and Just Systems Case Study
                    <para id="mid-008"><link id="mid-009" window="new" url="https://www.vtrenz.net/imaeds/ownerassets/850/Whitepaper-Siemens_Dynamic_Documents_PLM.pdf">This case study</link> will be familiar to many involved in the technical document and training alignment activities.  While the training component is not mentioned until a minor reference in the conclusion, the theme and the objectives are in complete alignment with the focus of this whitepaper.  It is a vendor Whitepaper and is well presented but with an obvious emphasis on the vendor’s technology.  Beyond that the content is very useful in providing a real world example.</para></item>
                <item>Multi-standard, single source publishing in the European Community
                    <para id="mid-010">As a result of the ADL’s S1000D – SCORM alignment activities, a range of vendors of have been focusing specifically in the area of single sourcing of authorized content within the context of documentation and training for defense and aerospace.  As per the ELIG educational publishing workgroup cited earlier, single source publishing appears also as an emerging business trend for learning content management platform providers with an increasing interest for multi-device content generation and delivery.  This would also include dynamic content aggregation, delivery and/or syndication from sources such as XML feeds, textbook repositories, web-based learning object repositories and editorial educational content etc.  Single sourcing would enable the delivery of such content to traditional target applications, mobile devices or any number of newer applications to support learning and training.</para>
                    <para id="mid-011">The European Commission has launched a range of important research and development programs that are focused on developing technologies and practices for the future of learning and training “on the move and into the workspace”.  Two such projects that are of interest to the focus of this paper are <link id="mid-012" window="new" url="http://www.mobilearn.org/">Mobilearn</link> and <link id="mid-013" window="new" url="http://www.wearitatwork.com/">Wear it at Work</link>.  <link id="mid-014" window="new" url="http://www.giuntilabs.com/">Giunti Labs</link>, recognised as a leading European provider of Learning Content Management Systems is involved in both Mobilearn and Wear it at Work.  Giunti Labs is investigating the use of single source XML production for both technical and textbook documentation to be delivered in print, online and through handheld, location-based mobile delivery.  As a result of their involvement with projects such as these, the need to provide single source publishing support has become increasingly evident.  The perspective that emerges is that of structured content being stored and managed in digital content repository and marketplace technologies and being made available to a wide variety of consuming applications.  It should ultimately be possible to embed, for example, S1000D, DocBook and DITA standards to enable single source content to support educational, maintenance, technical, textbook and learning content through multiple delivery streams.</para></item>
